			<h1>My Favorite Music</h1>

			<h3>Rufus du Sol</h3>
            <p>The Austrailian trio, Rufus du Sol, is one of my favorite artists to listen to right now. Their music is more of an electronic and dance style, but with great vocals as well. My favorite song by them is called Brighter and I recently saw them live at Red Rocks.</p>

            	<p>If you would like to learn more about Rufus du Sol, please visit their website <a href="https://www.rufusdusol.com/?frontpage=true" target="_blank">Rufus Du Sol</a></p>

            <h3>Lane 8</h3>
            <p>Lane 8 is another one of my favorite artists to listen to. I typically listen to Lane 8 when I am studying or walking to class as he has a very laidback and chill house style of music. Below is a list of my favorite Lane 8 songs.</p>
